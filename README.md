# MST
# P3 : Road Network Optimization using MST

A C program that constructs a **road network between cities** using **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms.  
The system loads city connections from a file, builds an adjacency list, and applies **Prim’s Algorithm** and **Kruskal’s Algorithm** to minimize the total road cost. It also compares execution time and total cost between the two algorithms.

## Features
- Load cities and road connections from `cities.txt`
- Represent the road map using adjacency lists
- Build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using:
  - Prim’s Algorithm
  - Kruskal’s Algorithm
- Compare execution time and total cost of both algorithms
- Display minimized road maps and cost summaries
